<li>Output IDs fall under “Ruleset mappings”, which fall under “Service mappings”</li>

<li>GPs are required to maintain a register of patients with certain conditions (e.g.&nbsp;dementia, cancer, diabetes)</li>
<li>See Output IDs with suffix <code>_REG</code> for code lists</li>
<li>Output IDs (also termed “Indicator IDs” in the Business Rules word documents) typically apply to patient populations defined by these registers (e.g.&nbsp;<code>AST007</code>, <code>AST008</code> &amp; <code>AST011</code> are all applied to population <code>AST_REG</code>)</li>
