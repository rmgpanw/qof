Welcome to my research website.

Additional analyses may be added by adding either `.qmd` or `.Rmd` notebooks in the `analysis` directory. These will be listed under the 'Analysis' tab when the website is rebuilt.

Re-run the analysis pipeline by running `targets::tar_make()`

```{r tar-visnetwork}
targets::tar_visnetwork(targets_only = TRUE,
                        callr_arguments = list(show = FALSE))
```
